# tic-tac-toe_v1
This game was entirely developed by me following a request from my parents on the family's WhatsApp group, who were bored at the start of the confinement, they liked too much. I would like to make it Multi-Player at the time but I did not have enough knowledge to realize it and therefore I made it Single-Player.
